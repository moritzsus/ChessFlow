# ChessFlow

(in early development)

Project Goal:

App for studying Chess Openings by adding the lines you want to remember. You can then play through your lines in a random order to check if you remeber the best moves. There will be an option to group your lines into specific openings. 
You can also analyze different positions at the Analysis Board.
